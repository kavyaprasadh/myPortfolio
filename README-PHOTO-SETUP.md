# Adding Your Profile Photo

## Steps to Add Your Passport Photo:

1. **Save your photo**: Save your passport photo as `profile-photo.jpg` in the same folder as `index-simple.html`

2. **Photo requirements**:
   - Format: JPG or JPEG
   - Name: `profile-photo.jpg`
   - Size: Recommended 400x400 pixels or larger
   - Location: Same folder as the HTML file

3. **Alternative names**: If your photo has a different name, you can:
   - Rename it to `profile-photo.jpg`, OR
   - Update the HTML file to match your photo's filename

## File Structure:
```
MyPortpolio/
├── index-simple.html
├── profile-photo.jpg  ← Add your photo here
├── README-PHOTO-SETUP.md
└── ... other files
```

## How to Update the Photo Path:

If your photo has a different filename, edit `index-simple.html` and change this line:
```html
<img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Kavyaprasad P" class="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-full">
```

Replace `profile-photo.jpg` with your actual photo filename.

## Photo Display:

Your photo will appear as a circular image in the About section with:
- Beautiful gradient background
- Professional styling
- Responsive design
- Proper aspect ratio

Once you add the photo file, refresh the browser to see your photo in the portfolio!
